The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts.
==============================================================
This git repository is for public tinkering and other interesting, publically publishable projects.
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is my public repository/code ramblings on GitHub.

This repository is most likely going to include mostly SQL, R and C.  The C will _not_ be very good (for now).  I'm mostly using this to refamiliarize myself with R, try very dumb (or interesting) queries in SQL, and to teach myself C.  We'll C how it goes.

For more information about the coder and his projects, you may visit his [website](www.zacharyklagge.com)

_Do not judge me for this code, lest ye be judged for your own._
